Qualified name: \`\`\`manim.animation.movement.PhaseFlow\`\`\`


\`\`\`class\`\`\` \`\`\`PhaseFlow\`\`\`(\`\`\`mobject\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`None\`\`\`, \`\`\`*\`\`\`\`\`\`args\`\`\`, \`\`\`use_override\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`True\`\`\`, \`\`\`**\`\`\`\`\`\`kwargs\`\`\`)¶
Bases: \`\`\`Animation\`\`\`
Methods



\`\`\`interpolate_mobject\`\`\`
Interpolates the mobject of the \`\`\`Animation\`\`\` based on alpha value.





Parameters:

function (Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray])
mobject (Mobject)
virtual_time (float)
suspend_mobject_updating (bool)
rate_func (Callable[[float], float])





\`\`\`interpolate_mobject\`\`\`(\`\`\`alpha\`\`\`)¶
Interpolates the mobject of the \`\`\`Animation\`\`\` based on alpha value.

Parameters:
alpha (float) – A float between 0 and 1 expressing the ratio to which the animation
is completed. For example, alpha-values of 0, 0.5, and 1 correspond
to the animation being completed 0%, 50%, and 100%, respectively.

Return type:
None
