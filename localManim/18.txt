Examples

Example: ShowIncreasingSubsetsScene ¶
\`\`\`from manim import *

class ShowIncreasingSubsetsScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        p = VGroup(Dot(), Square(), Triangle())
        self.add(p)
        self.play(ShowIncreasingSubsets(p))
        self.wait()\`\`\`


Methods



\`\`\`interpolate_mobject\`\`\`
Interpolates the mobject of the \`\`\`Animation\`\`\` based on alpha value.

\`\`\`update_submobject_list\`\`\`






Parameters:

group (Mobject)
suspend_mobject_updating (bool)
int_func (Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray])





\`\`\`interpolate_mobject\`\`\`(\`\`\`alpha\`\`\`)¶
Interpolates the mobject of the \`\`\`Animation\`\`\` based on alpha value.

Parameters:
alpha (float) – A float between 0 and 1 expressing the ratio to which the animation
is completed. For example, alpha-values of 0, 0.5, and 1 correspond
to the animation being completed 0%, 50%, and 100%, respectively.

Return type:
None
