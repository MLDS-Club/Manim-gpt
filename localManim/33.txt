SpinInFromNothing¶
Qualified name: \`\`\`manim.animation.growing.SpinInFromNothing\`\`\`


\`\`\`class\`\`\` \`\`\`SpinInFromNothing\`\`\`(\`\`\`mobject\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`None\`\`\`, \`\`\`*\`\`\`\`\`\`args\`\`\`, \`\`\`use_override\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`True\`\`\`, \`\`\`**\`\`\`\`\`\`kwargs\`\`\`)¶
Bases: \`\`\`GrowFromCenter\`\`\`
Introduce an \`\`\`Mobject\`\`\` spinning and growing it from its center.

Parameters:

mobject (Mobject) – The mobjects to be introduced.
angle (float) – The amount of spinning before mobject reaches its full size. E.g. 2*PI means
that the object will do one full spin before being fully introduced.
point_color (str) – Initial color of the mobject before growing to its full size. Leave empty to match mobject’s color.



Examples

Example: SpinInFromNothingExample ¶
\`\`\`from manim import *

class SpinInFromNothingExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        squares = [Square() for _ in range(3)]
        VGroup(*squares).set_x(0).arrange(buff=2)
        self.play(SpinInFromNothing(squares[0]))
        self.play(SpinInFromNothing(squares[1], angle=2 * PI))
        self.play(SpinInFromNothing(squares[2], point_color=RED))\`\`\`
