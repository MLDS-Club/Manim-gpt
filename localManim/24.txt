Write¶
Qualified name: \`\`\`manim.animation.creation.Write\`\`\`


\`\`\`class\`\`\` \`\`\`Write\`\`\`(\`\`\`mobject\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`None\`\`\`, \`\`\`*\`\`\`\`\`\`args\`\`\`, \`\`\`use_override\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`True\`\`\`, \`\`\`**\`\`\`\`\`\`kwargs\`\`\`)¶
Bases: \`\`\`DrawBorderThenFill\`\`\`
Simulate hand-writing a \`\`\`Text\`\`\` or hand-drawing a \`\`\`VMobject\`\`\`.
Examples

Example: ShowWrite ¶
\`\`\`from manim import *

class ShowWrite(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        self.play(Write(Text("Hello", font_size=144)))\`\`\`



Example: ShowWriteReversed ¶
\`\`\`from manim import *

class ShowWriteReversed(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        self.play(Write(Text("Hello", font_size=144), reverse=True, remover=False))\`\`\`


Tests
Check that creating empty \`\`\`Write\`\`\` animations works:
\`\`\`>>> from manim import Write, Text
>>> Write(Text(''))
Write(Text(''))\`\`\`


Methods



\`\`\`begin\`\`\`
Begin the animation.

\`\`\`finish\`\`\`
Finish the animation.

\`\`\`reverse_submobjects\`\`\`






Parameters:

vmobject (VMobject | OpenGLVMobject)
rate_func (Callable[[float], float])
reverse (bool)





\`\`\`begin\`\`\`()¶
Begin the animation.
This method is called right as an animation is being played. As much
initialization as possible, especially any mobject copying, should live in this
method.

Return type:
None





\`\`\`finish\`\`\`()¶
Finish the animation.
This method gets called when the animation is over.

Return type:
None
