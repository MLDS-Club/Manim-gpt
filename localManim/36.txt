Circumscribe¶
Qualified name: \`\`\`manim.animation.indication.Circumscribe\`\`\`


\`\`\`class\`\`\` \`\`\`Circumscribe\`\`\`(\`\`\`mobject\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`None\`\`\`, \`\`\`*\`\`\`\`\`\`args\`\`\`, \`\`\`use_override\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`True\`\`\`, \`\`\`**\`\`\`\`\`\`kwargs\`\`\`)¶
Bases: \`\`\`Succession\`\`\`
Draw a temporary line surrounding the mobject.

Parameters:

mobject (Mobject) – The mobject to be circumscribed.
shape (Type) – The shape with which to surround the given mobject. Should be either
\`\`\`Rectangle\`\`\` or \`\`\`Circle\`\`\`
fade_in – Whether to make the surrounding shape to fade in. It will be drawn otherwise.
fade_out – Whether to make the surrounding shape to fade out. It will be undrawn otherwise.
time_width – The time_width of the drawing and undrawing. Gets ignored if either fade_in or fade_out is True.
buff (float) – The distance between the surrounding shape and the given mobject.
color (ManimColor | int | str | tuple[int, int, int] | tuple[float, float, float] | tuple[int, int, int, int] | tuple[float, float, float, float] | ndarray[Any, dtype[int64]] | ndarray[Any, dtype[float64]]) – The color of the surrounding shape.
run_time – The duration of the entire animation.
kwargs – Additional arguments to be passed to the \`\`\`Succession\`\`\` constructor



Examples

Example: UsingCircumscribe ¶
\`\`\`from manim import *

class UsingCircumscribe(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        lbl = Tex(r"Circum-\\scribe").scale(2)
        self.add(lbl)
        self.play(Circumscribe(lbl))
        self.play(Circumscribe(lbl, Circle))
        self.play(Circumscribe(lbl, fade_out=True))
        self.play(Circumscribe(lbl, time_width=2))
        self.play(Circumscribe(lbl, Circle, True))\`\`\`
