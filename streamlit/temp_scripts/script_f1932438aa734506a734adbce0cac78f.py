Apple Crumble Recipe  
Serves 4–6 | Prep time: 15 min | Bake time: 35–40 min  

Ingredients  
1. Filling  
   • 6 medium tart apples (e.g. Granny Smith), peeled, cored, sliced ~½″ thick  
   • 2 Tbsp granulated sugar  
   • 2 Tbsp light brown sugar  
   • 1 tsp ground cinnamon  
   • Pinch of salt  
   • 1 Tbsp lemon juice (optional, to prevent browning)  

2. Crumble Topping  
   • 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour  
   • ⅔ cup (135 g) light brown sugar, packed  
   • ½ cup (45 g) rolled oats (old-fashioned)  
   • ½ tsp ground cinnamon  
   • Pinch of salt  
   • 6 Tbsp (85 g) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes  

3. To Serve (optional)  
   • Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream  

Directions  
1. Preheat & Prep  
   • Preheat your oven to 350 °F (175 °C).  
   • Lightly grease an 8×8″ (or similar size) baking dish.  

2. Make the Filling  
   a. In a large bowl, combine apple slices, 2 Tbsp granulated sugar, 2 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, pinch of salt, and lemon juice (if using).  
   b. Toss until the apple slices are evenly coated.  
   c. Transfer mixture into the prepared baking dish, spreading it in an even layer.  

3. Make the Crumble Topping  
   a. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup flour, ⅔ cup brown sugar, ½ cup oats, ½ tsp cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.  
   b. Add the cold cubed butter. Using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs (pea-sized pieces).  

4. Assemble & Bake  
   a. Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the apple layer.  
   b. Bake in the preheated oven for 35–40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling around the edges.  
   c. If the topping browns too quickly, tent loosely with foil for the last 5–10 minutes.  

5. Rest & Serve  
   • Allow the crumble to rest 5–10 minutes before serving so the juices thicken slightly.  
   • Spoon into bowls and top with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, if desired.  

Tips & Variations  
- Nuts & Spice: Stir ½ cup chopped walnuts or pecans into the topping. Add a pinch of nutmeg or ginger.  
- Fruit Mix: Replace half the apples with sliced pears, berries, or rhubarb.  
- Gluten-Free: Use a 1:1 gluten-free flour and gluten-free oats.  
- Make-Ahead: Assemble, cover tightly, and refrigerate up to 12 hours before baking. Increase bake time by ~5 minutes if baking straight from the fridge. Enjoy!
