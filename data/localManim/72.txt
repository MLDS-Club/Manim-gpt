MoveToTarget¶
Qualified name: \`\`\`manim.animation.transform.MoveToTarget\`\`\`


\`\`\`class\`\`\` \`\`\`MoveToTarget\`\`\`(\`\`\`mobject\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`None\`\`\`, \`\`\`*\`\`\`\`\`\`args\`\`\`, \`\`\`use_override\`\`\`\`\`\`=\`\`\`\`\`\`True\`\`\`, \`\`\`**\`\`\`\`\`\`kwargs\`\`\`)¶
Bases: \`\`\`Transform\`\`\`
Transforms a mobject to the mobject stored in its \`\`\`target\`\`\` attribute.
After calling the \`\`\`generate_target()\`\`\` method, the \`\`\`target\`\`\`
attribute of the mobject is populated with a copy of it. After modifying the attribute,
playing the \`\`\`MoveToTarget\`\`\` animation transforms the original mobject
into the modified one stored in the \`\`\`target\`\`\` attribute.
Examples

Example: MoveToTargetExample ¶
\`\`\`from manim import *

class MoveToTargetExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        c = Circle()

        c.generate_target()
        c.target.set_fill(color=GREEN, opacity=0.5)
        c.target.shift(2*RIGHT + UP).scale(0.5)

        self.add(c)
        self.play(MoveToTarget(c))\`\`\`
